In the third episode of commit.js we'll talk about TypeScript. We will use webpack and integrate TypeScript with our project. Later in the episode we will explore TypeScript decorators, so we can extract common functionalities.

In the next couple of series we will be developing our own Angular like library that will speed up our development process. 

The event will be broadcasted on youtube:
